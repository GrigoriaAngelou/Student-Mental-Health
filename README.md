# student-mental-health

This Data set was collected by a survey conducted by Google 
forms from University student in order to examine their current academic 
situation and mental health. The data set was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/
I discover and handle incorrect data, inconsistencies, and missing values with python Notebook.
And, I visualize the data using pivot tables in Excel making different plots to answer questions.
Finally, I write an article on my Portofolio projects explaining my findings.
