# student-mental-health

This Data set was collected by a survey conducted by Google 
forms from University student in order to examine their current academic 
situation and mental health. The data set was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/
I discover and handle incorrect data, inconsistencies, and missing values with python Notebook.
And, I visualize the data using pivot tables in Excel making different plots to answer questions.

## What is mental health and why is it so important?
Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. But, poor mental health is a problem that appears more and more in adolescence. Feelings of anxiety, depression and panic attack deluge the youth, causing behavioral  and bad temper problems in them. I used a dataset from , which is from a questionnaire on the effects of mental health on University students' CGPA. It is a rather small sample but it can say a lot about student's mental health and if this is related to their academic situation.<br>
